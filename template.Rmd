```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

I'm an R Markdown document!

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

```{r eval = TRUE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# learning assessment

this is code for the leaning assessment at P8105.

```{r}

la_df = 
    tibble(
      norm_samp = rnorm(n=500, mean=1),
      samp_g1 = norm_samp > 1
    )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = norm_samp)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
